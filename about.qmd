# Wayland the smith

Below is the production route of high-nitrogen alloyed sword called *Mimung*, according to **Wayland the smith**. He is is a **legendary figure from Germanic**, Norse, and Anglo-Saxon **mythology**.

He is often depicted as a master blacksmith and craftsman with almost supernatural skill in forging weapons and artifacts.

He searched for the finest piece of iron he could find, heated it until it glowed, and hammered it into a sword for seven days. Then he filed the sword into iron shavings, mixed them with goose feed, and fed the mixture to his geese.

From the droppings, he washed the iron filings and melted them down to forge a new sword. Wayland repeated this process three times. Thus, the sword *Mimung* was created - a blade said to be sharper than any other sword of its time.

From a **metallurgical perspective**, he did **everything right👌**. The iron filings absorbed nitrogen in the digestive tract of the geese, ultimately leading to high-strength (green) steel for the sword😉.

At **Energietechnik Essen GmbH (ETE)**, we have a highly advanced **p**ressure-**e**lectro**s**lag-**r**emelting furnace - our **'smart geese'🚀** - that produce sophisticated nitrogen-alloyed stainless steels, and another unit is currently under construction (see [HighTechETE](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7340666878916259840/) for more details).
