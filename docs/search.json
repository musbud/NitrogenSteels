    "text": "Nitrogen-alloyed stainless steels are special grades that are particularly used in the aerospace, energy, and medical sectors. Nitrogen, as a key alloying element, provides the material with high tensile strength, improves corrosion resistance, and stabilizes the formation of an austenitic microstructure.\nHowever, nitrogen has a low solubility in molten steel or iron (maximum approximately 0.04 wt-%). Higher nitrogen levels can be achieved by alloying with elements such as chromium, manganese, or molybdenum, which increase the solubility of nitrogen in molten steel. Another approach to retain nitrogen in molten steel is to increase the nitrogen partial pressure in the furnace. Energietechnik Essen GmbH (ETE) operates a pressure-electroslag-remelting (PESR) furnace to enhance the nitrogen content in stainless steels."

    "text": "Wayland the smith\nBelow is the production route of high-nitrogen alloyed sword called Mimung, according to Wayland the smith. He is is a legendary figure from Germanic, Norse, and Anglo-Saxon mythology.\nHe is often depicted as a master blacksmith and craftsman with almost supernatural skill in forging weapons and artifacts.\nHe searched for the finest piece of iron he could find, heated it until it glowed, and hammered it into a sword for seven days. Then he filed the sword into iron shavings, mixed them with goose feed, and fed the mixture to his geese.\nFrom the droppings, he washed the iron filings and melted them down to forge a new sword. Wayland repeated this process three times. Thus, the sword Mimung was created - a blade said to be sharper than any other sword of its time.\nFrom a metallurgical perspective, he did everything right👌. The iron filings absorbed nitrogen in the digestive tract of the geese, ultimately leading to high-strength (green) steel for the sword😉.\nAt Energietechnik Essen GmbH (ETE), we have a highly advanced pressure-electroslag-remelting furnace - our ‘smart geese’🚀 - that produce sophisticated nitrogen-alloyed stainless steels, and another unit is currently under construction (see HighTechETE for more details).\nIf you are interested in how we assess the performance💪 of - our ‘smart geese’🚀 - take a look here “Verlinkung zur”High nitrogen alloyed steels”.\n\n\n\nProduction of nitrogen alloyed sword according to Wayland the smith"
